In little bay called Tokamaru years ago it was  
A welcoming place of travelers repose  
The eve was Christmas celebrated with new friends  
On a deck underneath the summer sky they met.  

He was running from something painful in his past  
She was simply out there seeing the world  
Between the two there waxed affection and sparks flew  
From that night on, both of their lives would change.

----

They both moved on again   
This time together

All without a plan  
Follow the weather
