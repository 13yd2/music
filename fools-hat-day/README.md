1. A curious human phenomenon
1. this social construction
1. we base value on
1. TV says it's cool,
1. the radio too,

1. telling us what to do.

1. Regardless of budget,
1. financial constraints,
1. quality issues,
1. and safety complaints.
1. Just order it now,
1. have it shipped fast,
1. waste no more time,
1. suplies will not last.
