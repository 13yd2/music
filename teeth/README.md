1. Verse

  She told me her name was Jane  
  I didn't listen anyway  
  She punched me in the eye  
  It caught me by surprise  
  That's the whole story  
  No it's not, I lied.
  
  Anyway the whole thing goes like this you see.
  She told me the one I lost was me.
  Didn't understand what she said to me.
  Doesn't matter anyway, Doesn't matter anyway
  

2. Chorus

  Cause see, after all these years my friend  
  I found my teeth again  
  After all these years my friend  
  I found my teeth again  
  After all these years man  
  I found my teeth again  
  
3. Verse

  So I walked into a bar  
  The place was pretty cool  
  Didn't walk that far  
  And fell over that stool  
  This girl she looked me in the eye  
  It caught me all by surprise  
  She told me me "Hey, what are doing over there"  
  "That's a stool you see, you shouldn' be on there like that"  
  I didn't listen anyway  

4. Chorus  (Repeat)
