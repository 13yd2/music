The Rider
========

Wake,  
Wake up from your sleep  
Your friends are finally here  
Pretend like you're sincere now  
You deny  
You're alive  
You cant hide  
You're a lie  

----

Run  
Run as fast as you can  
The last man standing is damned  
So just abandon all the plans  
That you had  
They were bad  
Fucking bad
Fucking sad

----

Fire
Burn every bridge thats required
Salt the earth and destroy the entire
chance of life ever after - The rider
The rider
