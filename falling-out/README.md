Falling Out
===========


Lyrics

1. Verse

  Your paper soul  
  is stained with doubt  
  Your reason's wearing thin  
  You lose control  
  It's crawling out  
  It's crawling out your skin  
  Just play that role  
  remain devout  
  and hide it deep within  
  Before you know  
  without a doubt  
  it's falling out again  

2. Verse

  You fill the holes  
  with hopeless grout  
  You've spackled deep within  
  a black like coal  
  infused throughout  
  the source of your chagrin  
  Just play that role  
  remain devout  
  and hide it deep within  
  Before you know  
  without a doubt  
  it's falling out again  

1. Verse

  Your paper soul  
  is stained with doubt  
  Your reason's wearing thin  
  You lose control  
  It's crawling out  
  It's crawling out your skin  
  Just play that role  
  remain devout  
  and hide it deep within  
  Before you know  
  without a doubt  
  it's falling out again
