1. Verse

  Wacha doin wit dem pants on  
  You such a fashion fauxpas  
  
  Wacha doin wit dat shirt on  
  You such a fashion fauxpas  
  
  Wacha doin wit dat hat on  
  You such a fashion fauxpas  
  
  Whacha doin wit dem shoes on....
  
2. Chorus

  Your nails are wrong  
  Your hair's too long  
  Your makeup's wrong  
  And your friends all tell you again  
  Your life's a runway  
  Your life's a runway  
  Your life's a run away

  You such a fashion fauxpas  
  
  Wacha doin wit dat hat on  
  You such a fashion fauxpas
