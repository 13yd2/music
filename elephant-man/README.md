Elephant Man

Lyrics
------

1. Verse

  A young Joe Merrick was just plain sick of his life  
  Abandoned by his father, he was working in a spike  
  Without a whole lot of options, not for a guy like him  
  with skin like an elephant, and two enormous limbs  
  
2. Verse
  
  See his bones were growing, with no signs of them slowing
  His head alone weighed 60 pounds.
  
  
2. Chorus

  Well I, I find it's getting out of hand
