1. Verse

  I  
  I run to you  
  But you  
  You're running to  
  Wait for me, I want to come  
  And blame you for the things I've done  
  
2. Chorus

  I've been here before, I know my way  
  Through all the ins and outs of this cliche  
  Wade through all your shit to find out that everything is wrong  
  While I've been here, and I've been right all along  
  
3. Verse

  I  
  I wish for you  
  to see the world  
  the way I do  
  I'm the only one who can  
  seem to truely understand  

4. Chorus

  I've been here before, I know my way  
  Through all the ins and outs of this cliche  
  Wade through all your shit to find out that everything is wrong  
  While I've been here, and I've been right all along 

5. Verse

  I  
  I step on you  
  and everything  
  that's sacred too.  
  Fuck exactly what you are  
  Here I am the only star.  
  
6. Chorus

  I've been here before, I know my way  
  Through all the ins and outs of this cliche  
  Wade through all your shit to find out that everything is wrong  
  While I've been here, and I've been right all along
