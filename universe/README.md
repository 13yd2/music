1. Verse

  Let me tell you 'bout a man named Gray  
  Though his beard and hair are white  
  Known only for his masterpiece  
  Which he's worked on all his life  
  If you ask him he will show you  
  But he'll demand you pay the price  
  A dollar and a smile will buy you the right  
  to gaze in amazement upon his device  


2. Verse

  At first glance it looks rather plain  
  A marble like sphere so round  
  It's only when you look more closely  
  that it begins to seem profound  
  In an ink of purest black  
  Swim a trillion tiny lights  
  He says what you see are galaxies  
  Expanding through a vaacum of white  
  
3. Chorus
  
  He keeps it by his side, in a leather purse  
  With fidelity, and detail so diverse  
  A scale model of the entire universe  
  
  
4. Verse

  Yeah it's true that we're in there too  
  In the milky way deep inside
